#1 create a new python virtual enviornment
    virtualenv venv --develop
     source venv/bin/activate
#2 now install the project requirements


import "file_name(w/o .py)"
    -use to run a file
source venv/bin/activate
    -start the virtual env
pip install sqlalchemy>=0.7.3

__init.py__
__init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; 

--testing-- 
nosetest:
how does it work?
collects all of the tests that are subclasses of unittest.TestCase
all of the methods of the class you would like to run must be prefixed with "test_" in the name

it looks for things that appear to be tests using regx

nosetests "filename1" 

nosetests in the root directory will run all of the tests

mock:
-used to create fake objects for testing
Mock():
a flexible object that is intended to replace the stubs and test doubles in tests
