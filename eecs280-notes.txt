==RECURSION SLIDES==

*abstraction:
+hides uneccessay details
+reduces complexity
Types:
->procedural: functions
  Properties:
  	-Local: can be understood w/o looking at other code
	-Substitutable: replace with about implimentation
->data


recursive functions:
#1 what is the base case
#2 how can this problem be broken down into smaller ones


==TAIL RECURSION SLIDES==

tail recursion: 
+no pending computation
+usually involves a helper function with an additional parameter to keep track of state
+requires constant stack space
+bascially same as iteration

testing:
testing-discovering something is broken
debuging-fixing something that is broken

types:
1.incremental
+testing smaller easier to understand units	
+just wrote the code easier to fix

==TESTING & FUNCTION POINTERS SLIDES==

testing steps
#1 understand the spec
#2 id req behaviors
#3 write specific tests
#4 know the test ans
#5 stress test

test case classes
->simple
->boundry
->nonsense

regression testing: running tests to make sure new code didn't brake anything


function pointer: pointer to executable code in memory
+useful if you want to make similar functoins such as max/min

==RECURSION & ITERATION==
recursive problem: defined in terms of itself
+one or more base case
+way to solve bigger problem by first solving a smaller problem



*** ADD RECURSIVE STEP THROUGH EX ***

==ARRAYS & POINTERS SLIDES==

list: can grow as large as need be

array: fixed size, homogeneous, indexed
ex : int myarray[4] = { 1,2,4,5 }
int myfunc(int myarray[], int my_array_size);
+passed by reference

usage - cstring
char a[] = "foo"
a[0] = 'f'
a[1] = 'o'
a[2] = 'o'
a[3] = '\0'

pointers:address of an object
ex:
int foo;
int *bar;
bar = &foo;
foo = 1;
+ dereference operator = * what is at the address stored


==ARRAY TRAVERSAL SLIDES==
pointer arithmatic:just move this pointer to the by the amount of the
reference typpe 
ex bar  + 1 would just move to the next int in memory

some additional pointer notes:
const T *p; //T the pointer to obj cannot be changed
T *const p; //p the pointer cannont be changed
const T *const p //neither can be changed

==STRUCTS AND ENUMS SLIDES==
struct: compound object

struct myStuct{
  int var1;
  char abc;
};

const type name;
once the value is initialized it is never allowed to change
conts int would be a supertype of an int//this is backwards of what you would think

enum Rank = { BEST, AVG, WORST }

sometimes when working with enums you have to use

static_cast<Type>(value)

== INPUT & OUTPUT SLIDES ==

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) is the type signature of the main program

#1 compile:
g++ programm.cpp -o a.out
#2 run
./a.out 2 3 4

or 
./a.out >inputfile
./aout < outputfile

cin >>
cout <<

template--remember that they suck for trying to debug sometimes
example:

template <typename T>
T sum(T a[], int size)


== EXCEPTIONS SLIDES ==
try{
  if(...) throw x;

}
catch(type X){

}

== ABSTRACT DATA TYPES == aka classes
talking about WHAT something does vs HOW it does something

Abstract Data Tupe (ADT) : description of values and operations
+ INFORMATION HIDDING: we do not need to know the representation or implimentation of the object
+ ECAPSULATION: the objects and their operations are defined in the same place
+ ABSTRACTION: both local and substitutable

example 

class Myclass{
	//OVERVIEW:

	int v;
	public: 
		int get_value();
		//RME

		void set_value();

};

private: defualt of all the classes.  accessible only within the class and its members

public: accessible everywhere, within and outside the class scope

protected: accessible within the class and its methods and descendants

Constructor:call when you istantiate a new object of this type
syntax

ClassName::ClassName(){}


== ADT EFFICENCY & SUBTYPES SLIDES ==

substitution principle: a subtype may be provided where a supertype is expected

== SUBTYPES & SUBCLASSES SLIDES ==

3 ways to create a subtype:
1. weken the precondition of one or more operations
2. strengthen the postcondition of one or more operations
3. add one or more operations

c++ syntax:
class MaxIntSet : public IntSet{
	public:
		int max();
};

*virtual functions:
syntax: virtual void insert();

virtual keyword tells c++ to choose at runtime which version of a member to use.  It maybe overridden by a subclass.  The compilier creates a virtual table for each virtual function inited to the appropriate implimentation.

== INERFACES & INVARIANTS SLIDES ==

virtual base class/ abstact base class:  interface only class from which implimentation can be dervied.

syntax: 

virtual bool query() = 0;
this is a pure virtual function.  You cannot create any instances of this.  So you must create references and pointers to them.

you derive a subclass from the abstract class and put the implimentation in it.  Note:  must include a constructor since the abc can't have one.


now all you need is a access function in the implimentation
dy
static ImpAClass i;
IntSet *getAClass(){
  return &i;
}

so now for a user to access AClass:

AClass *a = getAClass();

invarient: a set of conditions, that evaluate to true or false, that must always be true for certain well defined points; otherwise the program is incorrect.  

3 types:
1. recursive
2. iterative
3. representation-applies to the data members comprising an impl of an adt

== MEMORY MODLES == 
3 types of objects:
1. global - space reserved at compile time
2. local - space reserved at runtime
3. dynamic - compilier doesn't need to know how big it will be or how long it will live

syntax: 
int *ip = new int; //allocates space on the heap

delete ip; //only objects created by new can be deleted

memory leak:  when you end up with dynamically allocated object that doesn't have anything pointing to it and can not be deleted.


The address space:
stack
THE BIG VOID
Heap
Global 
Text

== COPYING ARRAYS SLIDES ==
to delete arrays use:
delete[] ip;


destructor:  opposite of a constructor. if your class allocates dynamic memory then you need a destructor to deallocate that memory and avoid memory leaks.

syntax:
ClassName::~ClassName(){}

copy contructor: passing arguments by-value
tasks:
1. allocate an array of the same size as the source set's
2. copy each element from the source to the new
3. copy all the other members
syntax:
AClass(const AClass &source);

assignment operator: copies contents from one instance to another
