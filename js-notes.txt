--GOOGLE CLOSURES NOTES--
1. JS COMPILER: OPTIMIZES CODE AND MAKES IT EASIER TO MAINTAIN 
//MAKES A POST REQUEST TO THE API WITH THE TYPES OF OPTIMIZATIONS
  THE COMPRESSED OPTIMIZED CODE WILL BE IN THE RESPONSE

2. JS LIBRARY: DOM MANIPULATION, SERVER COMMUNICATION, DATA STRUCTURES, UNIT TESTING, RICH TEXT EDITING


3. JS TEMPLATES: DYNAMICALLY GENERATION PAGES





--COFFEE SCRIPT--
1. does all of the lexical scoping for you. aka you do not need to use var
2. cleaner and shorter syntax (sort of looks like python to me but takes from Ruby as well)
3. don't have to worry about using keywords like class, it will take care of quoting them for you
4. splats: used for defining/invoking functions with variable number of arguments
5. array slicing and splicing
6. classes become so much easier to deal with
7. chained comparisons
8. string interpolation from Ruby
9. Block style strings
