# Design Patterns & Idioms


## Strategy  

The strategy patter defines a family of algorithms, ecapsultes each one, and makes them interchangeable.  Strategy let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer Pattern

the Observer patten defines a one-to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Example: bulding a station display for diffenet weather measurements.

## Decorator Pattern

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.  Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Example: Starbucks cost calculation system for there beverages and all the options for them.

## The Factory Idiom


Example: Pizza shop ordering different types of pizza from different franchises.

# OO Principles

+ Encapsulate what varies 
+ Favor composition over inheritance
+ Program to an interface, not implimentations
+ Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
+ Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
