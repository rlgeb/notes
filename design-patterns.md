## Strategy  

The strategy patter defines a family of algorithms, ecapsultes each one, and makes them interchangeable.  Strategy let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Observer
the Observer patten defines a one-to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Example: bulding a station display for diffenet weather measurements.

## Decorator

The decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.  Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Example: Starbucks cost calculation system for there beverages and all the options for them.
